                    Your resume doesnâ€™t show who you are as a person, your enthusiasm, your 
                    <br>expressions, and so on. We believe that you are more than just a list of job 
                    <br>experiences and that employers deserve to know that just as much as you 
                    <br>deserve to show it.

            <h2 class="three">Bypass steps in your interview process</h2>
                <p class="three">
                    The interview process today is nothing short of a 5+ step process. Tadpole 
                    <br>allows users to help potentially shorten that interview process by giving 
                    <br>employers a more in-depth video view of who you are.
